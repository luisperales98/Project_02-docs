PCB design for Golf Ball Dispenser

I apologize for the messiness of the depository... At first I was not able to make subfolders, but then I did it but was not
able to delete the files already uploaded.

This repository shows the PCB design for my Golf Ball Dispenser Project. 
The general function for this device is that it dispenses a golf ball using a Servo motor when motion is detected from the PIR sensor and at the same time plays a little jingle as well. For more information, go to my hackster page below:
